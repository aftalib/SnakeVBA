# SnakeVBA

A small and fun project i did a few weeks ago using VBA and the Excel graphical interface was to recreate the famous Nokia Snake game. It was fun to create a game on a development environment that is normally not designed to program games.

In order to run this you need to activate developer mode on Excel and that's basically all you need to do.
